# Genetic-Terrarium
An ecosystem project with "plants" and "animals" evolving and interacting with each other


This project is explores cellular automata similar to Conway's Game of Life. The idea is to create a 2D world in which there is a resource layer that regenerates over time that "creatures" can move around on and eat. The creatures have a randomly generated decision tree brain that controls their actions. Creatures can move, eat, stay still and reproduce (asexually). When they reproduce they pass on their decision tree to their offspring with a chance of random mutation. As the creatures die if they do not find enough food and their control algorithm can mutate through generations the creatures can evolve to be more specialised at finding food.
